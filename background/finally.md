# Finally

Which is the best structure or file format type to use?&#x20;

A few years back, some folks I do research with looked at XML, JSON, and a proprietary binary format for transferring instrument data \[2]. The verbosity of XML ruled it out, despite being the oldest of the standards and probably the best supported.&#x20;

JSON is probably the most popular of these standards for modern web applications.&#x20;

YAML Is more economical in terms of file size, however many people object to using indentation to define code blocks. These same people really don't like Python!&#x20;

As in most cases, understand all relevant tools and use the most appropriate one for the job you're doing.
